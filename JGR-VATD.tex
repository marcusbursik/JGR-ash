VATD (volcanic ash transportation and dispersion) models require initial conditions, which describe the initial locus of ash that is then transported.
Most VATD models use a line source of some prescribed shape calibrated against an empirical expression for the height-MER relation.
Such empirical vertical ash distributions may not be good representations of actual vertical ash distributions, which usually vary from case to case and have complex dependencies on eruption source parameters and atmospherics conditions.
3D (three-dimensional) plume models provide an alternative way to create initial ash cloud without any assumption regarding plume geometry. By eliminating assumed behavior associated with the semiempirical plume geometry, the predict capacity of VATD simulation would be improved. However, no VATD simulation adopts initial condition created from 3D plume simulation yet. We explore this option for the first time in this paper. A volcanic plume model based on Lagrangian method is adopted to cooperate with another Lagrangian VATD model to demonstrate implementation details.
The importance of initial condition is shown in sensitivity analyses which prove that volcanic ash transportation simulation is much more sensitive to initial condition than all other input parameters. Further investigation reveals that initial particle distribution in vertical direction has more significant impact on transportation of ash clouds than horizontal distribution. Comparison also indicates that ash particles are concentrated along intrusion height of umbrella cloud that is much lower than the plume top, which is just momentum overshoot.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Volcanic Ash Transportation Forecast}
The fine-grained fraction of tephra (volcanic ash) can be widely dispersed and can lead to a degradation of air quality and pose threats to aviation. Identification of volcanic ash helps schedule the flights accordingly to avoid flying through area where ash presents. Numerical estimation of ash distribution using known wind fields is necessary if we are to accurately predict ash cloud evolution. Numerous VATD (volcanic ash transportation and dispersion) models have been developed by both civil and military aviation or meteorological agencies to provide forecasts of ash cloud motion \citep{witham2007comparison}. New techniques have been integrating with VATD to satisfy increasing demands for model accuracy and forecast reliability. This paper explores an alternative way for creating initial condition for VATD simulations, which promises to improve predict capability and accuracy.

As has been reported \citep[e.g.][]{fero2009simulating} and will be confirmed in this paper, initial condition has significant effects on simulation of volcanic ash transportation.
Traditional VATD simulation usually requires key global descriptors of the volcanic plumes. It is a common practice to pick up the ``best match" key global descriptors by parameter calibration \citep[e.g.][]{fero2008simulation,fero2009simulating, zidikheri2017estimation}. Often, 1D plume models also serve as an alternative option to provide the key global descriptors. For example, \citet{bursik2012estimation} and \citet{stefanescu2014temporal} use bent \citep{bursik2001effect} to generate global descriptors.
No matter how are these global descriptors obtained, they are used to define the initial condition for VATDs in forms of line source term which furnishes VATD with a spatio-temporal distribution of particles/mass along the eruption column. Vertical mass/particle distribution of line source term is calibrated against an empirical expression for the height-MER relation. The empirical expressions are written as functions of several parameters including key global descriptors.
Sometimes, an extra step is adopted to spread ash particles of line source horizontally resulting in an initial ash cloud in 3D space.
The horizontal spreading also depends on empirical expression. For example, PUFF spreads particle of line source uniformly in the horizontal direction within a given radius.
That is to say, both vertical distribution and horizontal distribution, if applicable, are based on empirical expressions.
Considering the complexities of volcano eruption, the actual ash distribution in initial ash clouds should vary from case to case. 
It is difficult to have one general expression that suitable for all cases. So it is necessary to investigate alternatives ways for creating initial ash clouds without assumptions on plume geometry. This is one major motivation of this paper.

\subsection{Numerical Tools}
VATD models can be categorized into particle tracking type and advection-diffusion type.
Among several available particle tracking models \citep[e.g.][]{walko1995hypact, searcy1998puff, d1998modeling, draxler1998overview} and advection-diffusion models \citep[e.g.][]{bonadonna2005total, folch2009fall3d, schwaiger2012ash3d}, we adopt a particle tracking model, PUFF \citep{tanaka1991development,searcy1998puff}, as the VATD model. PUFF can take 3D ash clouds as initial condition, which makes it technically easier to cooperate with 3D plume models. PUFF initializes a discrete number of tracers that represent a sample of the eruption cloud, and calculates transport, turbulent dispersion, and fallout for each representative tracer. While a cylinder emanating from the summit to a specified maximum height is the standard approach to crudely model the geometry of a typical ash column. It minimally requires horizontal wind field data. The ``restart feature" of PUFF makes it technically feasible to handle the difference between plume simulation and VATD simulation in terms of time scale and length scales.

Besides parameters calibration, 1D (one dimensional) plume models are also adopted to get global descriptors of volcanic plume.
1D plume models \citep [e.g.][]{woods1988fluid, bursik2001effect, mastin2007user, de2015plume, folch2016fplume, pouget2016sensitivity} usually simplify the scenario and account for mass, momentum and energy conservation in 1D. Due to the simplification in 1D plume models, the entrainment of air is evaluated based on two coefficients: entrainment coefficient due to turbulence in the rising buoyant jet and the crosswind field. Different 1D models adopt different entrainment coefficients based on specific formulation or calibration against well-documented case studies. The feedback from plume to atmosphere is usually ignored in 1D models. While these 1D models generated well-matched results with 3D models for weak plumes, much greater variability is observed for strong plume scenarios, especially in terms of local variables \citep{costa2016results}. On the other hand,
first principle based, entrainment coefficients free, 3D numerical models for volcanic plume \citep{oberhuber1998volcanic,neri2003multiparticle,suzuki2005numerical,cerminara2016ashee,cao2018plume} not only provides more accuracy prediction but also naturely create a 3D ash cloud, which can perfectly serves as initial condition for VATDs. However, to the best of author's knowledge, there is no VATD simulation taking such 3D ash clouds as initial condition yet. In this paper, we will carry out VATD simulation with initial ash cloud based on 3D plume simulation for the first time. 
Among these 3D plume models, we choose Plume-SPH \citep{cao2018plume} due to its easy availability to our group.

Theoretically, implementation techniques described in this paper can be applied for any combination of VATD model and 3D plume model even though our investigation is based on a specific VATD model and plume model.

\subsection{Pinatubo Eruption}

The 1991 eruption of Mountain Pinatubo is used as case study in this chapter. The Mountain Pinatubo erupted between June 12 and 16, 1991, after weeks of precursory activity. The climactic phase starts at June 15th 0441 UTC and ends around 1341 UTC \citep{holasek1996satellite}. This climactic phase generated voluminous pyroclastic flows and sent Plinian and co-ignimbrite ash and gas columns to great altitudes \citep{scott1996pyroclastic}. The evolution of the Pinatubo ash and $SO_2$ clouds was tracked using the visual spectrum \citep{holasek1996satellite}, the ultraviolet spectrum with a total ozone mapping spectrometer (TOMS) \citep{guo2004re}, and the infrared spectrum with a variety of sensors, including advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) \citep{guo2004particles}. There are also sufficient observational data to estimate the eruption condition for climactic phase of Pinatubo eruption \citep{suzuki2009three}. The availability of calibrated eruption condition and extensive observational data regarding ash clouds transportation makes the Pinatubo eruption an ideal case for our research.

\section{Setting up Simulations} \label{sec:Methodology}

\subsection{Creating of Initial Ash Cloud} \label{sec:create-initial-condition}

\begin{figure}

Figure on the top shows raw output of Plume-SPH, where, blue particles are for phase 1 (ambient air), red particles are for phase 2 (erupted material).

The figure on the third row is volcanic plume after cutting off lower portion.}
\label{fig:create-initial-ash-plume-sph}
\end{figure}

The steps to create initial ash cloud based on raw output of Plume-SPH are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:create-initial-ash-plume-sph}.
The method proposed in this paper generates initial ash cloud directly from output of 3D plume model casting aside assumptions regarding plume shape.
We take Plume-SPH as an example. In case of other 3D plume models, the steps are similar. Plume-SPH is a two phases model based on a Lagrangian method, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), in which, the computational domain is discretized by SPH particles. The current version, Plume-SPH 1.0 \citep{cao2018plume}, uses two types of SPH particles, particle of phase 1 to represent ambient air and particles of phase 2 to represent erupted material. Initial ash cloud is created from SPH particle of phase 2 in this paper. 
After reaching to the maximum height and starting spreading horizontally, particles of phase 2 forms an initial ash cloud, see, Fig. \ref{fig:Plume-SPH-Pinatubo-ash-cloud}. 3D plume simulation is considered being completed at this point. The lower part of the plume keeps moving vertically upwards and hence is involved only minimally in horizontal ash transport. Thereby, we cut off the lower part of the plume according to an elevation threshold. Considering SPH particles are essentially discretization points and have no size, we need to assign grain size to each particle according to given distribution, mean and standard deviation of grain size \citep{paladio1996tephra}. As a consequence, the discretization points (has no size) are switch to Lagrangian tracers with sizes. The coordinates of these tracers, which are in the local Cartesian coordinate system of Plume-SPH, need to convert into PUFF's global coordinate system, which is written in terms of $(longitude, latitude, height)$. PUFF then takes the initial ash clouds consisting of batch of Lagrangian tracers and propagates from time $t$ to time $t+\Delta t$ via an advection/diffusion equation \citep{searcy1998puff}.
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
\textbf{R}_i(t+\Delta t) = \textbf{R}_i(t) + \textbf{W}(t)\Delta t + \textbf{Z}(t)\Delta t +  \textbf{S}_i(t) \Delta t
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
Here, $\textbf{R}_i(t)$ is the position vector of $ith$ Lagrangian tracer at time $t$, $\textbf{W}$ accounts for wind advection, $\textbf{Z}$ accounts for turbulent dispersion and $\textbf{S}$ is the terminal gravitational fallout velocity, which depends on tracer's size.

To summarize, it takes four steps to create initial ash cloud from raw output of Plume-SPH:
\begin{enumerate}
\item filtering by SPH particle type to select SPH particles that represent erupted material (phase 2)
\item filtering by an elevation threshold to cut off the plume, only leaving the upper part
\item switching discretization points to Lagrangian tracers by assigning grain size to each particle
\item converting coordinates of Lagrangian tracers into VATDs' coordinate system
\end{enumerate}
The volcanic plume and initial ash clouds used in the case study are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:Plume-SPH-Pinatubo-ash-cloud}. It is necessary to point out that since both Plume-SPH and PUFF are based on Lagrangian method, no extra step for conversion between Lagrangian particles and Eulerian grids.

Table \ref{tab:VATDs-source-term-determination} compares three different methods for creating initial conditions for VATD simulation: 1) creating initial condition based on parameter calibration without any plume model (method 1), 2) creating initial condition based on output of 1D plume model (method 2), 3) extracting initial ash cloud from 3D plume simulation (method 3). The first method determines all global descriptors of volcanic plume based on calibration. Then create initial line source or ash cloud according to semiempirical plume shape expression. Both other two methods depend on plume models. However 3D plume models can generate initial ash cloud in 3D space while 1D plume models only obtain global descriptors of plume so still need semiempirical expression to create 3D initial ash cloud. In addition, the number of Lagrangian tracers is a free parameter when using semiempirical plume shape expressions while it purely depends on simulation when creating initial condition from 3D plume simulation results.

\end{table}

\subsection{Restart PUFF}

The plume development and ash transportation are of different time scale and length scale. Spatial and temporal resolution of plume simulation is much finer than that of ash transportation. The computational domain of VATD simulation is much larger than that of plume simulation.
It takes around tens of minutes ($600 s$ in this case) for Pinatubo plume to reach a steady height. However the duration of eruption persists for a few hours (9 hours for the climactic phase of Pinatubo eruption). It is computationally too expensive to do 3D plume simulation up to several hours. In order to handle the difference in time scale, we mimic successive eruption with intermittent pulsing releasing of ash particles. Particularly, we restart PUFF at an interval of $600 s$, which is physical time of plume simulation. At every restart, we integrate the output of last PUFF simulation and the ash cloud obtained from output of Plume-SPH into a new ash cloud. This new ash cloud serves as a new initial condition when restart PUFF simulation. The interval of the pulsing release equals to the simulation time of plume model, that is $600 s$ in our case study. A sketch demonstrating the overall restart process is in Fig. (\ref{fig:Restart-Puff}). The total number of Lagrangian tracers used in PUFF equals to summation of numbers of particles in all releases. So the total number of tracers is not a parameter selected by user any more.
\citet{fero2008simulation} proposed using more realistic time-dependent plume heights. We do not adopt that strategy here due to lack of well-estimated time-dependent eruption conditions, although the idea is straightforward to consider.

    \label{fig:Restart-Puff}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Sensitivity Analysis of Other Parameters}

Besides the initial ash cloud, other input parameters for PUFF simulation are: horizontal diffusivity, vertical diffusivity, mean grain size, grain size standard deviation and total number of tracers. We present in this subsection systematic sensitivity studies on these parameters. We also investigate the influence of eruption duration.
The sensitivity analyses will serve as basis for identifying possible sources of disparities between simulation and observation.

The sensitivity analyses illustrate that adjustment of other input parameters produces negligible visual differences in VATD simulation results. Using different vertical diffusivities in range of $[100, 100000] m^2s^{-1} $ and different horizontal diffusivities in range of $[1, 20] m^2s^{-1}$ produces visually negligible differences. 
The eruption duration should depend on the actual eruption duration (or the duration of climactic phase) of a specific eruption. We conducted several simulations with eruption duration varying in range of $[5, 11] hours$ with slight different starting time of climactic phase. Table \ref{tab:Pinatubo-eruption-duration} lists all these simulations. However, only tiny visible differences are observed among the simulated ash transportation. The mean of grain size also has visually ignorable effects on long-term ash transportation according to our sensitivity tests varying the log mean (base 10) grain radius in a range of $[-7.3, -3.5] m$. 
The standard deviation, when varying in range of $[0.1, 10]$, generate ignorable difference on long-term ash transportation as well. Similar conclusion on parameter sensitivity is reported by \citet[e.g.][]{fero2008simulation, daniele2009applications}.
Among these parameters, the eruption duration and beginning time shows, even though tiny, the most obvious influence on simulated ash distribution. In order to show such differences in an intuitive way, Fig. \ref{tab:Pinatubo-eruption-duration} shows simulated ash distribution corresponding to 4.9 hours duration, 9 hours duration and 11 hours duration respectively. After 72 hours, relative to the simulation starting time, these three cases generate generally similar results, with high concentration ash covers almost the same region. The difference of lower concentration distribution is relatively more obvious. Ash cloud covers broadest area when eruption duration is 11.1 hours. To summarize, all these parameters have either tiny or ignorable affects on long-term ash distribution simulation.

    \label{fig:PUFF-sensitivity-duration}
\end{figure}

The new methodology for generating initial ash cloud introduces another new parameter: elevation threshold. We also carry out sensitivity analysis on this parameter by varying the elevation threshold from $1500 m$ (the height of the vent) to $25000 m$. The simulated ash distributions show obviously visible differences. Such influence is especially obvious when the elevation threshold is either very large or very small. However, varying the elevation threshold in the range of $[12000, 18000] m$ generates relatively small difference in ash transportation simulation results. Figure \ref{fig:PUFF-sensitivity-elevation-threshold} compares the simulated ash distribution corresponding to elevation thresholds of $1500 m$ and $15000 m$. Compared with ash distribution for threshold of $15000 m$, an extra long tail appears when using elevation threshold of $1500 m$. Adopting smaller elevation thresholds essentially adds more tracers at lower elevation. As the wind at different elevations are different, these newly added tracers at lower elevation would transpose to different directions.

    \label{fig:PUFF-sensitivity-elevation-threshold}
\end{figure}

The sensitivity analyses demonstrate that the initial condition for VATD simulation has the most significant effect on simulated ash distribution while all other input parameters have either tiny or ignorable influence. The initial ash cloud generated based on semiempirical expression, which is a function of several parameters, might be significantly disparate from realistic ash cloud. Such initial condition might greatly compromise the accuracy of VATDs simulation.

We do not carry out any investigation with respect to wind field even though it is another dominant factor in VATD simulation. In the case study, we use global $NOAA/OAR/ESRL 6-h, 2.0^{\circ}$ reanalysis wind fields data \citep{whitaker2004reanalysis, compo2006feasibility, compo2011twentieth}.

\section{Comparison and Discussion}

Transportation of volcanic ash resulted from Pinatubo eruption on June 15th 1991 is simulated using two different initial conditions.
The initial condition is created in traditional way according to key global descriptors and semiempirical plume shape expression. The second initial condition is created by the new method proposed in this paper.  Simulated ash transportation results are compared against observation.

To create initial condition using the new method described in this paper, the plume raising up process is simulated first by Plume-SPH. The eruption parameters, material properties and atmosphere for the strong plume no wind case in a comparison study on eruptive column models \citep {costa2016results} are adopted. Eruption conditions and material properties are listed in Table \ref{tab:input_parameters_plume_simulation}. Note that the density of erupted material at the vent and radius of the vent can be computed from the given parameters. The eruption pressure is assumed to be the same as pressure of ambient at the vent and hence is not given in the table. The vertical profiles of atmospheric properties were obtained based on the reanalysis data from ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) for the period corresponding to the climactic phase of the Pinatubo eruption. The initial ash cloud is obtained by processing the raw output of Plume-SPH following steps described in Sec. \ref{sec:Methodology}.

Another set of initial condition is created based on observed top height ($40 km$) and several other parameters assigned semiempirically \citep{bursik2012estimation}. These parameters, namely, the global descriptors of volcanic plume, are used as parameters of semiempirical expression to get ash cloud in 3D space. See details in Table \ref{tab:input_parameter_PUFF_simulation}. The simulation parameters that control VATD simulation are the same for both simulations. As has been shown in sensitivity analyses section, these parameters have less influence on simulation results than initial condition.

The differences between simulated ash transportation by ``Semiempirical initial cloud +PUFF" and ``Plume-SPH+PUFF" are obvious. The simulated ash concentration based on initial condition created from Plume-SPH is much closer to observation than that based on semiempirical plume shape expression. Around 23 hours and 31 hours after the beginning of the climactic phase, ``Plume-SPH + PUFF" simulation generates ash images that generally close to observational image, especially the location where high concentration ash presents. However, these ash at near west to Pinatubo mountain observed in satellite images does not show up in ``Plume-SPH + PUFF" simulation results. This disparity is very possible due to the fact that the Mountain Pinatubo continued erupting after climactic phase while our simulation only simulates the climactic phase. The ash released after climactic phase is not accounted in our simulation results. The ``Semiempirical initial cloud + PUFF" simulation, however, forecasts an ash distribution faster and narrower than observation. The location, where the high concentration ash presents, locates to the far northwest of observed ash. 
Around 55 hours after the beginning of the climactic phase, the disparity between observation and simulation becomes more obvious. Ash distribution of ``Semiempirical initial cloud + PUFF" simulation locates far west to the observed ash. The high concentration area of ``Plume-SPH + PUFF" simulation, even though closer to observation than that of ``Semiempirical initial cloud +PUFF", is still faster than observation.

At the stage of ash transportation simulation, except for the initial condition, both simulations adopt the same parameters and wind field data. That is to say, the only difference between these two simulations is the initial condition. Recall the initial condition has most significant influence on ash transportation simulation. It is very possible that the big difference between simulation results by ``Plume-SPH+PUFF" and ``Semiempirical initial cloud +PUFF" is attribute to the initial condition.

\subsection{Discussion Regarding Maximum Height ($H_{max}$)}

In this section, we majorly focus on the vertical distribution of ash particles in initial ash cloud.
The majority of volcanic ash particles usually present a lower elevation than maximum height. For instance, \citet{holasek1996satellite, holasek1996experiments} reported the maximum Pinatubo plume height as high as around $39 km$ while the cloud heights were estimated at $20 \sim 25 km $, \citet{self1993atmospheric} report the maximum plume height could be $>35 km$ and the plume heights are $23 \sim 28 km$ after $15 \sim 16$ hours. The neutral buoyant regions of the Pinatubo aerosol estimated by different measurements are: $17 \sim 26 km$ (lidar) by \citet{defoor1992early}, $20 \sim 23 km$ (balloon) by \citet{deshler1992balloonborne}, $17 \sim 28 km$ (lidar) by \citet{jager1992pinatubo}, and $17 \sim 25 km$ (lidar) by \citet{avdyushin19931}. Based on comparison between simulated cloud with early infrared satellite images of Pinatubo, \citet{fero2008simulation} reported that the majority of ash was transported between $16 km$ and $18 km$. This is physically understandable as particles are concentrated along intrusion height of umbrella cloud, not near top because the plume top is due to momentum overshoot. However, the empirical expressions for the height-MER relation, which are commonly adopted to create initial conditions for VATD simulation, tends to place majority of ash particles closer to top if use observed maximum height in the empirical expressions.

Here we check two commonly used plume shapes, the Poisson and Suzuki.
For Poisson plume shape, the vertical height of ash particles are determined according to Eq. (\ref{eq:Poisson-plume-shape}).
\begin{equation}
H=H_{max} - 0.5 H_{width}*P+H_{width}R
\label{eq:Poisson-plume-shape}
\end{equation}
where $P$ is an integral value drawn from a Poisson distribution of unit mean, $R$ is a uniformly distributed random number between 0 and 1, $H_{max}$ is the maximum plume height, $H_{width}$ represents an approximate vertical range over which the ash will be distributed.
For Suzuki plume shape \citep{suzuki1983theoretical}, volcano ash mass vertical distribution is assumed to follow the Suzuki equation (Eq. (\ref{eq:Suzuki-plume-shape})).
\begin{equation}
Q(z)=Q_m* \frac{k^2(1-z/H_{max})exp\left(k(z/H_{max} -1 )\right)}{H_{max}\left[1-(1+k)exp(-k)\right]}
\label{eq:Suzuki-plume-shape}
\end{equation}
Where $Q_m$ is the total mass of erupted material, $k$ is shape factor, which is an adjustable constant that controls ash distribution with height. A low value of $k$ gives a roughly uniform distribution of mass with elevation, while high values of $k$ concentrate mass near the plume top.

Particle distribution (in terms of mass percentage or particle number percentage) in vertical direction in the initial ash cloud are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:Particle-distribution-Plume-SPH-vs-semiempirical}. In that figure, the vertical particle distribution based on Plume-SPH output is compared with vertical particle distribution created based on semiepirical shape expressions. Both Poisson and Suzuki distribution in Fig. \ref{fig:Particle-distribution-Plume-SPH-vs-semiempirical} take $H_{max} = 40000m$, which is close to reported observation of maximum height. When adopting Poisson plume shape, the majority of the particles are between $30 km \sim 40 km$. Obviously, Poisson distributes majority ash at a much higher elevation than observations \citep[e.g.][]{fero2008simulation}. As for Suzuki, the majority of ash particles also distribute in a range that significantly higher than $25 km$. As for initial ash cloud based on Plume-SPH simulation, the major population of ash particles distribute between $17 km \sim 28 km$, which match well with observations. The maximum height is also consistent with observation. To summarize, using semiempirical plume shape expression generates unrealistic initial ash cloud even if we use observed plume maximum height.

    \label{fig:Particle-distribution-Plume-SPH-vs-semiempirical}
\end{figure}

For Poisson and Suzuki plume shape, vertical distribution of ash particles can't be lower down without changing the maximum height. To distribute major population of ash particles at lower elevation, the maximum height has to be reduced to a value smaller than observed maximum height. Adjusting parameters such as maximum height in the emperical expression is actually the traditional source term calibration method. A set of initial ash clouds using different maximum heights based on Poisson plume shape is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:Particle-distribution-Plume-calibrate-semiempirical}). The maximum heights adopted in plume shape expressions are, by no means, obtained from any plume model or observation. Except for maximum height, all other parameters for creating initial ash cloud are the same as these in Table \ref{tab:input_parameter_PUFF_simulation}. The range, between which major populations of ash particles locate, is lower when using smaller maximum heights. These ash clouds created by Poisson distribution with different maximum heights are then used as initial condition in PUFF simulation, whose results are show in Fig. \ref{fig:Various-Maximum-height-Pinatubo-ash-cloud}.

    \label{fig:Various-Maximum-height-Pinatubo-ash-cloud}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:Various-Maximum-height-Pinatubo-ash-cloud} shows that the maximum height has significant influence on ash transportation simulation. When the maximum height is $10000 m$ the high concentration area is lag behind observation. While the designated maximum height is $35000 m$, the high concentration area is a little bit faster and much narrower than observation. When using maximum height of $41343.9 m$, the high concentration area is faster and narrower than both observation and ``Pume-SPH+PUFF" simulation results (see Fig. \ref{fig:Plume-SPH-PUFF-ash-cloud}). The simulated high concentration area is closest to ``Pume-SPH+PUFF" simulation results when assigning a maximum height of $30000 m$. The front of volcano ash, with lower concentration is faster than observation locating far west to high concentration area. A lower concentration tailing area also appears in the simulation results while there is no such tail in observed image. PUFF simulation result based on calibrated maximum height of $30000 m$ shows similar footprint to, even though smaller in terms of covered area than, those of ``Pume-SPH+PUFF" simulation. However, the initial ash cloud created by Poisson distribution with maximum height around  $20000 m$ generates best match ash distribution with observation. That is to say, a maximum height lower than real maximum height is required by Poisson plume shape to distribute ash particles at the same elevation as real ash distribution. This is physically understandable as maximum plume heights are reached due to overshoot. 
Our hypothesis regarding the sources of disparity between "Semiempirical initial cloud +PUFF" simulation and observation is confirmed. Since the initial condition has so dominant effect on VATD simulation, it is very necessary to explore more accurate and adaptive ways for establishing the initial conditions.

\subsection{Discussion Regarding Vertical Spread ($H_{width}$)}
In previous section, the maximum height is adjusted to change vertical ash distribution along the source line. This section investigates another parameter in semiempirical possion expression. We vary the ``vertical spread" ($H_{width}$) in range $3 km /~ 10 km$. A set of initial ash clouds created according to different ``vertical spread" is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:poisson-vertical-spread}. Except for ``vertical spread", all other parameters for creating initial ash cloud are the same as these in Table \ref{tab:input_parameter_PUFF_simulation}. Width of the range within which major populations of ash particles locate become narrower when a smaller value for vertical spread is used. But changing $H_{width}$ has no obvious affect on the height at which majority of ash particles distribute. These ash clouds based on different vertical spread are then used as initial condition in PUFF simulation, whose results are show in Fig. \ref{fig:Various-vertical-spread-Pinatubo-ash-cloud}.

Adjusting of the vertical spread can change particle distribution in vertical direction and not surprisely affect VATD simulation results. Unluckily, none of these VATD simulations based on initial ash cloud with vertical spread equals to $3km$, $5km$, and $10 km$ get better results than VATD simulation based on initial condition created by a 3D plume simulation using Plume-SPH (see Fig. \ref{fig:Various-vertical-spread-Pinatubo-ash-cloud}).

\end{figure}

The calibrations carried out here are definitely not exhaustive. One might do more comprehensive calibration throughout the multi-dimensional (two dimensional for Poisson distribution) parameter space and get better matched ash transportation results. With more complicated plume shape expression, one could have more control over plume shape and might be able to get initial condition that much closer to actual initial ash cloud, hence obtain more accurate ash transportation prediction. But more complicated plume shape expression usually leads to higher dimensional parameter space which requires more effort to do calibration. Even though, the degree of freedom to adjust plume shape is still limited. The new method for creating initial conditions based on 3D plume simulation is more adaptive to various cases and obviates semiempirical expressions regarding plume shape.

\subsection{Horizontal Ash Distribution}

The differences between assumed plume particle distribution and actual (or simulated by 3D plume) model are not only in vertical direction. How cloud horizontal particle distribution of the initial ash cloud affect ash transportation is investigated in this section. PUFF uses a uniformly distributed random process to determine the ash particle location in a circle centered on the volcano site. The maximum radius (at top) is given as ``horizontal spread" in Table \ref{tab:input_parameter_PUFF_simulation}. The horizontal displacement from a vertical line above the volcano is a random value within a circle of radius, which equals to ``horizontal spread" multiplied by the ratio of the particle height $H$ to maximum $H_{max}$. So the net shape of the plume is an inverted cone where particles are located directly over the volcano at the lowest level and extend out further horizontally with increasing plume height. As for output of Plume-SPH, an effective radius is determined according to a given threshold of ash concentration following \citet {cerminara2016large}. A time averaging and spatial integration of the dynamic 3D flow fields are conducted to get rid of significant fluctuations in time and space. Fig. \ref{fig:radius-comparison} compares radius of initial ash clouds created by 3D plume simulation and assumed plume shape expression adopted in PUFF. Obviously, there is no chance for these two radius to be similar. Adjusting the parameter ``horizontal spread" could not make the assumed plume shape to be similar to ash cloud created by Plume-SPH. That is to say, merely parameter calibration is not enough for such situation. It would require higher order semiempirical expression that takes more parameters.
%Plume shape expression and parameters adopted by other VATD models might be different.

The plume shape expression used in PUFF defines an inverted cone whose actual shape changes when ``horizontal spread" takes different values. $R=25km$ is corresponding to ``horizontal spread" equals to $50km$. $R=50km$ is corresponding to ``horizontal spread" equals to $100km$}

\end{figure}

Comparison between cross-sectional veiws of the initial ash clouds is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:initial-cloud-horizontal}. The cross-sectional view of assumed plume shape (last figure in Fig. \ref{fig:initial-cloud-horizontal}) is similar to cross-sectional view of simulated 3D plume in general sense. However, for simulated 3D plume, the ash particle distribution on cross section varies along with height. It is hard for semiempirical expressions have such feature. In PUFF, particle distribution on cross sections is assumed to be the same.

Assigning different values to ``horizontal spread" has ignorable effect on VATD simulation results. We use numbers between $50 km$ to $1600 km$ as ``horizontal spread" to create initial ash cloud for VATD, all of them generate very similar results. Figure \ref{fig:radius-comparison-Pinatubo-ash} shows two different simulation results based on initial ash cloud with ``horizontal spread" equals to $50 km$ and $600 km$ respectively. No visible differences can be told between them. This implies that horizontal distribution has less significant influence on VATD simulation results than verticla distribution.

\section{Conclusion}

This paper presented, for the first time, VATD simulation using intial condition created by a 3D plume model while traditional VATD simulation using initial condition created according to semiemperical plume shape expression. Case study of Pinatubo eruption demonstrates that 3D plume model can create more realistic initial ash cloud and improve accuracy of ash transportation forecast. In order to explain why we got much closer ash dispersal forecast merely by adopting alternative initial conditions, more investigations were conducted. Sensitivity analyses illustrate that initial condition has more significant effects on volcanic ash transportation forecast than most of the other parameters. Comparison of vertical ash distribution between 3D plume model, semiempirical expression and observations reveals that major population of ash particles are at much lower elevation than maximum height. For the case study of Pinatubo eruption, ``well-matched" simulation results are observed when using maximum height of around $30 km$, which is much lower than observed maximum height of $40 km$. Calibrating of the maximum height, vertical spread and horizontal spread shows that ash particle distribution in vertical direction has more dominant effect on VATD simulation. 

This new method provides an alternative option for creating initial conditions for VATD simulation. Except for the disadvantage of high computational cost it helps overcome several shortcomings of existing methods.
As numerical models based on first principle, 3D plume models eliminate parameterization and hence user intervention associated with entrainment coefficients, thereby, improve forecast capacity of ash transportation simulation. More importantly, no assumption about plume shape is needed in this new method. The plume shape generated directly by 3D simulation is more adaptive to various scenarios, thereby, could be more realistic.
Contrastingly, semiempirical plume shape expressions only have several parameters to control the vertical ash particle distribution of line source or the shape of initial ash cloud, it might have difficulties to generate initial condition that close to reality for some eruptions. In theory, the methodology can be applied to any combination of VATD model and 3D plume model even though a specific 3D plume model and VATD model is used in this paper.

The full range of research issues raised by the numerical forecasting of volcanic clouds is many and diverse. We described in this paper the effect of initial conditions on numerical forecasts of volcanic ash transportation simulation.
Wind field, another important factor in volcanic ash transportation simulation is not discussed in the present work. Some other aspects, such as small scale physical processes, even though plays less roles, might need to be included by VATDs to improve accuracy for particular eruption event. In addition, the eruption condition, hence the initial ash clouds, are subject to change during eruption even during climactic phase of eruption. More realistic, time-dependent, initial condition for VATDs can be created from 3D plume simulation with time-dependent eruption conditions.
